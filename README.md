# SEER - V2
### At a glance...
 The SEER-V2 is an Assistive Navigation API aiming to provide Spatial Perception through Computer Vision to Aid Autonomous Systems and the Visually Impaired for Day to Day Navigation.  Through Monocular Depth Estimation, Object Detection and Object Pose Estimation, The SEER-V2 aims to Provide Crude Distance Estimates through Ergonomic Knowns.

### The Integration of the Integral Novel Monocular Depth Estimation Solution: 
Spatial Recognition Provides the Visually Impaired and Autonomous Systems the Ability to Recognize Obstacles in their day to day interactions. Depth Maps are not new, although recently, the recent release of MiDas has provided a novel solution to generate Depth Maps. In the past, Stereo-Vision, Lidar solutions were the primary technique to generate Depth Maps although MiDas relieves the community with a cost effective solution in Monocular Depth Estimation. Through Neural Networks,  

### The Object Detection Contribution :

In Physics and in Basic Trigonometry we understand 



### The Angle Orientation Principle : 
 In 3D graphics, we precieve object orientation through Pitch, Yaw and Roll (x,y and z rotation) of an Object. 
 If we were to extract the Euler Angles Of an Object, We are Able to Derive the projected 2D pixel Height of an Object from the 3D Bounding Box thus allowing us predict the distance Estimate.
