### Monocular Depth Estimation : 
Spatial Recognition through

### Angle Orientation Principle : 
 In 3D graphics, we precieve object orientation through Pitch, Yaw and Roll (x,y and z rotation) of an Object. 
 If we were to extract the Euler Angles Of an Object, We are Able to Derive the projected 2D pixel Height of an Object from the 3D Bounding Box thus allowing us predict the distance Estimate.
